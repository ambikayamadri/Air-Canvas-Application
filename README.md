# Air-Canvas-Application
Drawing just anything from our imagination by waving our finger in the air has always been very fascinating. In recent years, drawing in the air has been one of the most exciting and hard study areas in the world of image processing and pattern recognition. It makes a significant contribution to the progress of an automated process and can enhance the interaction between man and machine in a variety of ways. The creation of natural "human-computer interaction systems" to replace existing systems is becoming increasingly important as technology advances. Through this application, we make creative paintings like artists on the Canvas on air just by waving our hands. For this, we build an Air Canvas which can draw anything on it just by capturing the motion of a coloured object at our tip of the finger like a marker with the help of a camera.
